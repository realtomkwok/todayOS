# todayOS

## Overview
Since the launch of iPhone, apps have always been taking the center stage of the OS. We have to switch between apps to get and share information, while we often find ourselves lost track and got distracted. What if an OS can gather the information we need across different apps, and present them in a unified, decluttered way, or more specifically, like in a timeline? So we can have an overview of our day, and get a sense of what's happening around us, without being overwhelmed.

That's what todayOS is aiming to achieve.

## Core Design

- Timeline: View and interact with time-sensitive notifications, live updates, and planned events in a timeline. 
- Drawers: Like IRL, your desk can have drawers to store your stuff. In todayOS, a drawer is not exclusive to apps, but also  to keeping your frequently contacted people, copied items, your thoughts and idea in one place. A dock is the first row of the drawers, like an opening drawer.

## Gestures
- Tap and hold: Tap and hold an item in the timeline, drawers or dock, to get more actions.
- Swipe on the timeline: Swipe up and down on the timeline to navigate through the days.
- Swipe between drawers: Swipe left and right on the drawers to navigate between different drawers (default: apps, people, clipboard).
